Walls of Fire Stat - A universal netstat program for Linux, Windows, BSD, OSX, and Solaris.

	Tired of all the different netstat programs out there?
	Tired of remember if it's -tulpan, -bano, -an -f inet?
	Or was it lsof? pfiles? sockstat?

Why not give wofstat a shot?

	I know what you're thinking, not another *stat program...

	Is it easy to use?
		./wofstat

	It can also be used in conjunction with wof:
		./wofstat -w

Note on Solaris:

	It is literally easier to upgrade to 11 then it is to get good networking information out of it...

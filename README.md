Walls of Fire Stat - A universal netstat program for Linux, Windows, BSD, OSX, and Solaris.

	Tired of all the different netstat programs out there?
	Tired of remember if it's -tulpan, -bano, -an -f inet?
	Or was it lsof? pfiles? sockstat?

Why not give wofstat a shot?

	I know what you're thinking, not another *stat program...

	Is it easy to use?
		./wofstat

For Windows:

	Mingw does not contain the newest Windows headers.
	On XP SP3+ you must compile using VS or the Cygwin version of g++ (sadly).
